Tests for LDAP functionality
============================

This directory contains a test suite for LDAP functionality.  This
requires a full OpenLDAP installation, including server and client
tools, and is therefore kept separate and not run by default.


Running the tests
=================

    make check

NOTE: This requires the --enable-tap-tests argument to configure.
