Regression tests for cluster file encryption
============================================

This directory contains scripts for testing cluster file encryption.
The first two tests test the encryption/decryption using AES128 and
AES256 in GCM mode and two Key Wrap (KWP/KW) methods.

The third test tests that the data encryption keys can be encrypted and
decrypted, and tests cluster key rotation via pg_alterckey.  Since the
data encryption keys don't encrypt/decrypt any data yet (2021-01-20),
"CFE DEBUG" lines output the data keys for testing purposes.  It is
these debugging lines that are tested by this third script.

Running the tests
=================

Run
    make check
or
    make installcheck
You can use "make installcheck" if you previously did "make install".
In that case, the code in the installation tree is tested.  With
"make check", a temporary installation tree is built from the current
sources and then tested.

Either way, this test initializes, starts, and stops a test Postgres
cluster.

Requirements
============

OpenSSL must be compiled into the server for these test to run;  if not
the tests are skipped.
