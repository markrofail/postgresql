test_rbtree is a test module for checking the correctness of red-black
tree operations.

These tests are performed on red-black trees that store integers.
Since the rbtree logic treats the comparison function as a black
box, it shouldn't be important exactly what the key type is.

rbtree in postgres has 4 kinds of traversals: Left-Current-Right,
Right-Current-Left, Current-Left-Right and Left-Right-Current.

Checking the correctness of the first two types is based on the fact that
red-black tree is a binary search tree, so the elements should be visited in
increasing (for Left-Current-Right) or decreasing (for Right-Current-Left)
order.

In order to verify the last two strategies, we perform the traversal and
then retrospectively see if the resulting sequence meets the constraints
for a preorder or postorder binary tree, that is that we can recursively
divide it into a root, a left subtree containing only values less than
the root, and a right subtree containing only values greater than the root.
We also do a manual tree descent and verify that it matches the results
of the iterator.  (This manual descent requires knowing a bit more than
we should about RBNodes: we have to touch the left and right sublinks,
which rbtree.h says we should not, and we have to know how to identify
empty leaf nodes.)

Also, this module does some checks of the correctness of the find, delete
and leftmost operations.
