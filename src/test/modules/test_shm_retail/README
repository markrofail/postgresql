test_shm_retail is an example of how to use ShmContext and its facility. It
is not intended to do anything useful on its own; rather, it is a
demonstration of how these facilities can be used, and a unit test of
those facilities.

This extension allows a backend to put a list of number into the shared
memory and another backend to get the list. To use this extension, you need
to add shared_preload_libraries = 'test_shm_retail'.
