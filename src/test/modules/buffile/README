This extension was written to check if changes introduced due to cluster
encryption do not break buffile.c.

Caution: To make the test cheaper, it was decided to adjust the segment sizeq,
see

#define MAX_PHYSICAL_FILESIZE	(4 * BLCKSZ)

in buffile.c. BLCKSZ is 8192 (the default). All the tests rely on this
value. So if you haven't compiled Postgres with this value, the tests will
create 1 GB files and they will fail.
