Atomic Commit for Distributed Transactions
===========================================

The atomic commit feature enables us to commit and rollback either all of
foreign servers or nothing. This ensures that the database data is always left
in a consistent state in term of federated database.


Commit Sequence of Global Transactions
---------------------------------------

We employee two-phase commit protocol to achieve commit among all foreign
servers atomically. The sequence of distributed transaction commit consists
of the following four steps:

1. Foreign Server Registration
During executor node initialization, accessed foreign servers are registered
to the list FdwXactAtomicCommitParticipants, which is maintained by
PostgreSQL's the global transaction manager (GTM), as a distributed transaction
participant. The registered foreign transactions are tracked until the end of
transaction.

2. Pre-Commit phase (1st phase of two-phase commit)
we record the corresponding WAL indicating that the foreign server is involved
with the current transaction before doing PREPARE all foreign transactions.
Thus in case we loose connectivity to the foreign server or crash ourselves,
we will remember that we might have prepared transaction on the foreign
server, and try to resolve it when connectivity is restored or after crash
recovery.

The two-phase commit is required only if the transaction modified two or more
servers including the local node. In other case, we can commit them at this
step by calling CommitForeignTransaction() API and no need further operation.

After that we prepare all foreign transactions by calling
PrepareForeignTransaction() API. If we failed on any of them we change to
rollback, therefore at this time some participants might be prepared whereas
some are not prepared. The former foreign transactions need to be resolved
using pg_resolve_foreign_xact() manually and the latter ends transaction
in one-phase by calling RollbackForeignTransaction() API.

3. Commit locally
Once we've prepared all of them, commit the transaction locally.

4. Post-Commit Phase (2nd phase of two-phase commit)
The steps so far are done by the backend process committing the transaction but
this resolution step (commit or rollback) is done by the foreign transaction
resolver process. The backend process inserts itself to the wait queue, and
then wake up the resolver process (or request to launch new one if necessary).
The resolver process enqueue the waiter and fetch the distributed transaction
information that the backend is waiting for. Once all foreign transaction are
committed or rollbacked the resolver process wake up the waiter.


Foreign Data Wrapper Callbacks for Transaction Management
-----------------------------------------------------------

The core GTM manages the status of individual foreign transactions and calls
transaction management callback functions according to its status. Each
callback functions PrepareForeignTransaction, CommitForeignTransaction and
RollbackForeignTransaction is responsible for either PREPARE, COMMIT or
ROLLBACK the transaction on the foreign server respectively.
FdwXactRslvState->flags could contain FDWXACT_FLAG_ONEPHASE, meaning FDW can
commit or rollback the foreign transaction in one-phase. On failure during
processing a foreign transaction, FDW needs to raise an error. However, FDW
must accept ERRCODE_UNDEFINED_OBJECT error during committing or rolling back a
foreign transaction, because there is a race condition that the coordinator
could crash in time between the resolution is completed and writing the WAL
removing the FdwXact entry.


Foreign Transactions Status
----------------------------

Every foreign transactions has an FdwXact entry. When preparing a foreign
transaction a FdwXact entry of which status starts from FDWXACT_STATUS_INITIAL
are created with WAL logging. The status changes to FDWXACT_STATUS_PREPARED
after the foreign transaction is prepared and it changes to
FDWXACT_STATUS_PREPARING, FDWXACT_STATUS_COMMITTING and FDWXACT_STATUS_ABORTING
before the foreign transaction is prepared, committed and aborted by FDW
callback functions respectively(*1). And the status then changes to
FDWXACT_STATUS_RESOLVED once the foreign transaction are resolved, and then
the corresponding FdwXact entry is removed with WAL logging. If failed during
processing foreign transaction (e.g., preparing, committing or aborting) the
status changes back to the previous status. Therefore the status
FDWXACT_STATUS_xxxING appear only during the foreign transaction is being
processed by an FDW callback function.

FdwXact entries recovered during the recovery are marked as in-doubt if the
corresponding local transaction is not prepared transaction. The initial
status is FDWXACT_STATUS_PREPARED(*2). Because the foreign transaction was
being processed we cannot know the exact status. So we regard it as PREPARED
for safety.

The foreign transaction status transition is illustrated by the following graph
describing the FdwXact->status:
