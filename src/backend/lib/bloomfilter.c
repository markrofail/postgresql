 *		Minimal Bloom filter
 *
 * A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure that is used to test an
 * element's membership of a set.  False positives are possible, but false
 * negatives are not; a test of membership of the set returns either "possibly
 * in set" or "definitely not in set".  This can be very space efficient when
 * individual elements are larger than a few bytes, because elements are hashed
 * in order to set bits in the Bloom filter bitset.
 *
 * Elements can be added to the set, but not removed.  The more elements that
 * are added, the larger the probability of false positives.  Caller must hint
 * an estimated total size of the set when its Bloom filter is initialized.
 * This is used to balance the use of memory against the final false positive
 * rate.

 * Create Bloom filter in caller's memory context.  This should get a false
 * positive rate of between 1% and 2% when bitset is not constrained by memory.
 *
 * total_elems is an estimate of the final size of the set.  It ought to be
 * approximately correct, but we can cope well with it being off by perhaps a
 * factor of five or more.  See "Bloom Filters in Probabilistic Verification"
 * (Dillinger & Manolios, 2004) for details of why this is the case.
 *
 * bloom_work_mem is sized in KB, in line with the general work_mem convention.
 *
 * The Bloom filter behaves non-deterministically when caller passes a random
 * seed value.  This ensures that the same false positives will not occur from
 * one run to the next, which is useful to some callers.
 *
 * Notes on appropriate use:
 *
 * To keep the implementation simple and predictable, the underlying bitset is
 * always sized as a power-of-two number of bits, and the largest possible
 * bitset is 512MB.  The implementation is therefore well suited to data
 * synchronization problems between unordered sets, where predictable
 * performance is more important than worst case guarantees around false
 * positives.  Another problem that the implementation is well suited for is
 * cache filtering where good performance already relies upon having a
 * relatively small and/or low cardinality set of things that are interesting
 * (with perhaps many more uninteresting things that never populate the
 * filter).
