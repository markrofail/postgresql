PostgreSQL Database Management System
=====================================

This directory contains the source code distribution of the PostgreSQL
database management system.

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
that supports an extended subset of the SQL standard, including
transactions, foreign keys, subqueries, triggers, user-defined types
and functions.  This distribution also contains C language bindings.



Download
========

The latest version of this software, both in source code form and as
binary packages for many platforms, may be obtained at

	https://www.postgresql.org/download/

PostgreSQL has many language interfaces, many of which are listed here:

Building on UNIX
================

Detailed instructions for many Unix platforms are available here:
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/installation.html

To build PostgreSQL on most Unix variants, the following are required:

GNU make, version 3.8 or newer
ISO/ANSI C compilar (at least C99-compliant)
Flex 2.5.31 or later, and Bison 1.875 or later (for building from git)
Perl 5.8.3 (for building from git)

PostgreSQL has many additional capabilities which can be enabled using
configure --enable switches but many of those also depend on additional
libraries.  See the installation instructions for details.

To build PostgreSQL, run the following commands:

./configure
make

PostgreSQL can then be installed using 'make install', which will
require being a superuser to install into the default directory.
The installation location can be changed by passing '--prefix' to
'configure'.  Run './configure --help' for additional options.


Building on Windows
===================

Detailed instructions for building on Windows is available here:

	https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/install-windows.html

To build PostgreSQL on Windows, either Visual Studio Express 2017
for Windows Desktop or Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 (or later) should be
installed.  PostgreSQL can also be built using MinGW or Cygwin using
the Unix instructions.

There are different requirements for building on a 32-bit or 64-bit
environment, check the documentation for details.


Initializing your Database
==========================

Once the PostgreSQL software is installed, the first step to having a
running database is to initialize a PostgreSQL database, using the
'initdb' command:

initdb -D /path/to/mydatabase

Where '/path/to/mydatabase' is the directory where the database is
going to be installed. This directory can exist, but must be empty.
If it does not exist, 'initdb' will create it.

After the database system has been initialized, PostgreSQL can be
started by using the pg_ctl command:

pg_ctl -D /path/to/mydatabase -l logfile start

Once PostgreSQL is running, you can connect to it using the psql
command-line client.  A default database called 'postgres' was created
by 'initdb'.


Building the PostgreSQL Documentation
=====================================

Full documentation for PostgreSQL is available online here:

	https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/index.html

PostgreSQL uses DocBook to build the documentation. Therefore the
DocBook tools must be installed. In addition, a working Java
installation is required.

To build PostgreSQL's documentation on Unix, run:

./configure
make docs

The documentation, once built by 'make docs', will be available in
various formats in the 'doc/src/sgml' directory.
