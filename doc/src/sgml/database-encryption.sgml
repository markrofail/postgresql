  <title>Encryption Key Management</title>

  <para>
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> supports internal
   <firstterm>Encryption Key Management System</firstterm>, which is designed
   to manage the life cycles of cryptographic keys within the
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.  This includes dealing with their
   generation, storage, usage and rotation.
  </para>

  <para>
   Encryption key management system is enabled when
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> is built with
   <literal>--with-openssl</literal> and
   <xref linkend="app-initdb-cluster-passphrase-command"/> is specified during
   <command>initdb</command>.  The cluster passphrase provided by
   <option>--cluster-passphrase-command</option> option during
   <command>initdb</command> and the one generated by
   <xref linkend="guc-cluster-passphrase-command"/> in the
   <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> must match, otherwise, the database
   cluster will not start up. Please note that the cluster passphrase command
   passed to <command>initdb</command> must return a passphrase equal or longer
   than 64 bytes and less than 1024 bytes. For example.
<programlisting>
initdb -D dbname --cluster-passphrase-command="cat /path/to/passphrase-file"
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
   Encryption keys managed by <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s
   key management system are only used for the internal usage such as
   transparent data encryption in a future release.  These encryption keys never
   be taken out of database in the plaintext form.  Also, encryption key
   management system controls pre-defined encryption keys.  There is no
   interface to add and remove managed encryption keys.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="key-encryption-key">
   <title>Key Encryption Key(<acronym>KEK</acronym>)</title>

   <para>
    During <command>initdb</command> process, the cluster passphrase provided
    by <option>--cluster-passphrase-command</option> is derived into
    <firstterm>Key Encryption Key (<acronym>KEK</acronym>)</firstterm>.
    <acronym>KEK</acronym> encapsulates cryptographic keys managed inside
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> described in
    <xref linkend="key-derivations"/> using by a way of authenticated
    encryption described in <xref linkend="key-wrapping"/> before storing
    the keys to a persistent storage. <acronym>KEK</acronym> must be stored
    in a trusted key store, such as key vault software or services, or a
    hardware security module.
   </para>

   <para>
    When a <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server with encryption key
    management enabled is started, the <varname>cluster_passphrase_command</varname>
    parameter in <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> will be evaluated and
    the cluster passphrase will be derived into <acronym>KEK</acronym> in similar
    ways as initdb.
   </para>

   <para>
    After that, the cryptographic keys will be retrieved from
    <filename>pg_cryptokeys</filename> directory to be restored and
    integrity-checked by the key management system using <acronym>KEK</acronym>.
    If this process fails, it is likely that the cluster passphrase supplied
    to the cluster is not the same as that supplied to the
    <command>initdb</command> process.  The cluster will refuse to start in this
    case and user has to manually correct the cluster passphrase.
   </para>

   <para>
    <acronym>KEK</acronym> is not stored physically within the
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server as they are designed
    to be derived from the correctly configured cluster passphrase.
   </para>

  <sect2 id="key-derivations">
   <title>Key Derivations</title>

   <para>
    Encryption key management system can manage multiple cryptographic keys
    that have different purposes and usages within <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.
    Currently, encryption key management system manages no cryptographic key.
   </para>

  <sect2 id="key-wrapping">
   <title>Key Protection</title>

   <para>
    Key management system persists cryptographic keys to the disk after wrapping
    them by <acronym>KEK</acronym>.  This section describes how key maangement
    system wrap and unwrap key.
   </para>

   <para>
    Key management system uses Encryption with Associated Data
    (<acronym>AEAD</acronym>) to wrap cryptographic keys, which is a form of
    encryption. In addition to provide a way to protect confidential data from
    being revealed, it provides a way to check its integrity and authenticity
    of some associated data.  It follows Encrypt-Then-MAC approach, basing on
    the composition of the Advanced Encryption Standard (<acronym>AES</acronym>)
    in the Cipher Block Chaining (<acronym>CBC</acronym>) mode of operation
    for encryption with random initialization vector(<acronym>IV</acronym>) and
    the <literal>HMAC-SHA</literal> message authentication code
    (<acronym>MAC</acronym>).
   </para>

   <para>
    Key management system uses two kinds of cryptographic keys for key wrapping:

  <sect2 id="key-management-rotation">
   <title>Key Rotation Process</title>

   <para>
    Encryption keys in general are not interminable, the longer the same key
    is in use, the chance  of it being breached increases. Performing key
    rotation on a regular basis help meet standardized security practices
    such as <ulink url="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/">PCI-DSS</ulink>
    and it is a good practice in security to limit the number of encrypted
    bytes available for a specific key version. The key lifetimes are based
    on key length, key strength, algorithm and total number of bytes
    enciphered. The key management system provides a efficient method to
    perform key rotation.
   </para>

   <para>
    Please be aware that the phrase <literal>"key rotation"</literal> here
    only refers to the rotation of <acronym>KEK</acronym>. The cryptographic
    keys managed by encryption key management system are not rotated; they
    will in fact be the same before and after a <literal>"key rotation"</literal>.
    This can be justified because the actual keys are never stored anywhere
    physically, presented to user or captured in logging. What is being
    rotated here is the <acronym>KEK</acronym> who is responsible for
    encapsulating and restoring cryptographic keys.
   </para>

   <para>
    Since <acronym>KEK</acronym> is derived from a cluster passphrase, the
    <literal>"key rotation"</literal> ultimately refers to the rotation of
    cluster passphrase and deriving a new <acronym>KEK</acronym> from the
    new cluster passphrase. The new <acronym>KEK</acronym> can then be used
    to encapsulate all encryptions keys and store the new results in
    <filename>pg_cryptokeys</filename> directory.
   </para>

   <para>
    To complete the cluster passphrase rotation, user needs to follow the
    steps below:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Ensure the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server is running
      correctly with KMS enabled.  Passphrase rotation cannot be completed
      with the server shut down.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Update <xref linkend="guc-cluster-passphrase-command"/> parameter and
      load such that the new command will return a new cluster passphrase.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      In a session, execute <function>pg_rotate_cluster_passphrase()</function>
      SQL function to initiate the rotation. The function returns true upon
      successful key rotation and false if otherwise.
<programlisting>
=# SELECT pg_rotate_cluster_passphrase();
pg_rotate_cluster_passphrase
------------------------------
 t
(1 row)
</programlisting>
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>

   <para>
    Upon successful cluster passphrase rotation, all managed cryptographic keys
    will be re-encapsulated by the new <acronym>KEK</acronym> derived from the
    new cluster passphrase. The new encapsulated  keys will be stored in
    <filename>pg_cryptokeys</filename> directory.  Please note that the cryptographic
    keys are the same as before; the rotation process only changes the
    <acronym>KEK</acronym> that is used to encapsulate and verify the actual
    cryptographic keys. This way, there is no need to decrypt all the encrypted
    data with the old keys and re-encrypt them with the new.
   </para>

   <para>
    In case of a crash during the cluster passphrase rotation process, the key
    management system is able to recover to the previous sets of cryptographic
    keys the next time server starts up. This is possible because the key rotation
    and encapsulation process are done on a separate temporary key directory called
    <filename>pg_cryptokeys_tmp</filename> and it will replace
    <filename>pg_cryptokeys</filename> and be deleted only when everything is
    successfully finished. If the server starts with pg_cryptokeys_tmp folder present,
    it would indicate that previous attempt of cluster passphrase rotation was not
    completed. In this case, the server will discard <filename>pg_cryptokeys_tmp</filename>
    folder and load the keys in <filename>pg_cryptokeys</filename> as usual.
