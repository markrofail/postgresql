    <listitem>
     <para>
      To combine a collection of data values into a single value, whose value
may not be of the same type as the original values. Aggregate functions combine
multiple rows that share a common set of values into one row, which means that
the only data visible in the values in common, and the aggregates of the
non-common data.

    <term><glossaryterm>Logged</glossaryterm></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A table is considered Logged if changes to the table are send to the WAL
log. By default, all regular tables are logged. A table can be speficied as
unlogged either at creation time or via the ALTER TABLE command. The primary use
of unlogged tables is for storing transient work data that must be shared across
processes, but with a final result stored in logged tables.  Temporary tables are
always unlogged.

    <term><glossaryterm>Materialized</glossaryterm></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The act of storing information rather than just the means of accessing the
information. This term is used in Materialized Views meaning that the data
derived from the view is actually stored on disk separate from the sources of
that data. When materialized is used in speaking about mulit-step queries, it
means that the data of a given step is stored (in memory, but that storage may
spill over onto disk)
     </para>

    <term><glossaryterm>Partition</glossaryterm></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A Table that can be queried independently by its own name, but can also be
queried via another table, a partitioend table, which is a collection of
sub-tables, each capable of holding one defined subset of information that does
not overlap with any other table in the set of tables.
     </para>
     <para>
      A defined boundary used in an Analytic function to identify which
neighboring rows can be considered by the function for this particular row.

    <term><glossaryterm>Primary Key</glossaryterm></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A Unique Index defined on a Table or other Relation that also guarantees
that all of the Attributes within the Primary Key do not have null values.
As the name implies, there can be only one Primary Key per table, though it is
possible to have multiple Unique Indexes that also have no null-capable
attributes.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term><glossaryterm>Procedure</glossaryterm></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>

transactional statements like COMMIT and ROLLBACK.

    <term><glossaryterm>Schema</glossaryterm></term>
    <listitem>

   <varlistentry>
    <term><glossaryterm>Select</glossaryterm></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The command used to query a database. Normally, SELECTs are not expected
to modify the database in any way, but it is possible that functions invoked
within the query could have side-effects that do modify data.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term><glossaryterm>Serializable</glossaryterm></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>

   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term><glossaryterm>Session</glossaryterm></term>

   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term><glossaryterm>Temporary</glossaryterm></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Temporary tables are tables that exist either for the lifetime of a
Session or a Transaction, as defined at creation time. The data in them is not
visible to other Sessions, and is not logged. Temporary tables are most often
used to store intermediate data for a multi-step data transformation.
     </para>

    <term><glossaryterm>Transaction</glossaryterm></term>
    <listitem>

   <varlistentry>
    <term><glossaryterm>Trigger</glossaryterm></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A function which can be defined to execute whenever a certain operation

   <varlistentry>
    <term><glossaryterm>Tuple</glossaryterm></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A collection of Attributes in a fixed order. That order may be defined by
the Table where the Tuple is found, in which case the Tuple is often called a
Row or Record. It may also be defined by the structure of a Result Set.
     </para>

    <term><glossaryterm>Unlogged</glossaryterm></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>

log, which would enable those changes to be duplicated on a replica, and also
enables the change to survive a database crash.

    <term><glossaryterm>Update</glossaryterm></term>
    <listitem>

   <varlistentry>
    <term><glossaryterm>View</glossaryterm></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A Relation that is defined by a Select Statement, but has no storage of its own. Any
time a query references a View, the definition of the view is substituted into
the query as if the user had typed that subquery instead of the name of the
view.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term><glossaryterm>Window Function</glossaryterm></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A type of function similar to an aggregate in that can derive its value
from a set of rows in a result set, but still retaining the original source
data.
