  <para>
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> supports two internal
   built-in compression methods (<literal>pglz</literal>
   and <literal>zlib</literal>), and also allows to add more custom compression
   methods through compression access methods interface.

  <title>Built-in Compression Access Methods</title>
  <para>
   These compression access methods are included in
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> and don't need any external extensions.

  <title>Basic API for compression methods</title>

  <para>
   Each compression access method is described by a row in the
   <link linkend="catalog-pg-am"><structname>pg_am</structname></link>
   system catalog.  The <structname>pg_am</structname> entry
   specifies a name and a <firstterm>handler function</firstterm> for the access
   method.  These entries can be created and deleted using the
   <xref linkend="sql-create-access-method"/> and
   <xref linkend="sql-drop-access-method"/> SQL commands.
  </para>

  <para>
   A compression access method handler function must be declared to accept a
   single argument of type <type>internal</type> and to return the
   pseudo-type <type>compression_am_handler</type>.  The argument is a dummy value that
   simply serves to prevent handler functions from being called directly from
   SQL commands.  The result of the function must be a palloc'd struct of
   type <structname>CompressionAmRoutine</structname>, which contains everything
   that the core code needs to know to make use of the compression access method.
   The <structname>CompressionAmRoutine</structname> struct, also called the access
   method's <firstterm>API struct</firstterm>, contains pointers to support
   functions for the access method. These support functions are plain C
   functions and are not visible or callable at the SQL level.
   The support functions are described in <xref linkend="compression-am-functions"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   The structure <structname>CompressionAmRoutine</structname> is defined thus:
<programlisting>
typedef struct CompressionAmRoutine
{
    NodeTag     type;

    cmcheck_function        cmcheck;        /* can be NULL */
    cminitstate_function    cminitstate;    /* can be NULL */
    cmcompress_function     cmcompress;
    cmcompress_function     cmdecompress;
} CompressionAmRoutine;
</programlisting>
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="compression-am-functions">
  <title>Compression Access Method Functions</title>

  <para>
   The compression and auxiliary functions that an compression access
   method must provide in <structname>CompressionAmRoutine</structname> are:
  </para>

  <para>
<programlisting>
void
cmcheck (Form_pg_attribute att, List *options);
</programlisting>
   Called when an attribute is linked with compression access method. Could
   be used to check compatibility with the attribute and other additional
   checks.
  </para>

  <para>
  Compression functions take special struct
  <structname>CompressionAmOptions</structname> as first
  parameter. This struct contains per backend cached state for each
  attribute compression record. CompressionAmOptions is defined thus:

<programlisting>
typedef struct CompressionAmOptions
{
    Oid         acoid;          /* Oid of attribute compression */
    Oid         amoid;          /* Oid of compression access method */
    List       *acoptions;      /* Parsed options, used for comparison */
    CompressionAmRoutine *amroutine;    /* compression access method routine */

    /* result of cminitstate function will be put here */
    void       *acstate;
} CompressionAmOptions;
</programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
  The <structfield>acstate</structfield> field is used to keep temporary state
  between compression functions calls and stores the result of
  <structfield>cminitstate</structfield> function. It could be useful to store
  the parsed view of the compression options.
  </para>

  <para>
  Note that any invalidation of <structname>pg_attr_compression</structname> relation
  will cause all the cached <structfield>acstate</structfield> options cleared.
  They will be recreated on the next compression functions calls.
  </para>

  <para>
<programlisting>
void *
cminitstate (Oid acoid, List *options);
</programlisting>
  Called when <structname>CompressionAmOptions</structname> is being
  initialized. Can return a pointer to memory that will be passed between
  compression functions calls.
  </para>

  <para>
<programlisting>
struct varlena *
cmcompress (CompressionAmOptions *cmoptions,
            const struct varlena *value);
</programlisting>
   Function is used to compress varlena. Could return NULL if data is
   incompressible. If it returns varlena bigger than original the core will
   not use it.
  </para>

  <para>
<programlisting>
struct varlena *
cmdecompress (CompressionAmOptions *cmoptions,
              const struct varlena *value);
</programlisting>
   Function is used to decompress varlena.
  </para>
