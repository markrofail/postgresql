 <para>
  The <filename>amcheck</> module provides functions that allow you to
  verify the logical consistency of the structure of indexes.  If the
  structure appears to be valid, no error is raised.
 </para>

 <para>
  The functions verify various <emphasis>invariants</> in the
  structure of the representation of particular indexes.  The
  correctness of the access method functions behind index scans and
  other important operations relies on these invariants always
  holding.  For example, certain functions verify, among other things,
  that all B-Tree pages have items in <quote>logical</> order (e.g.,
  for B-Tree indexes on <type>text</>, index tuples should be in
  collated lexical order).  If that particular invariant somehow fails
  to hold, we can expect binary searches on the affected page to
  incorrectly guide index scans, resulting in wrong answers to SQL
  queries.
 </para>
 <para>
  Verification is performed using the same procedures as those used by
  index scans themselves, which may be user-defined operator class
  code.  For example, B-Tree index verification relies on comparisons
  made with one or more B-Tree support function 1 routines.  See <xref
  linkend="xindex-support"> for details of operator class support
  functions.

      This example shows a session that performs verification of every
      catalog index in the database <quote>test</>.  Details of just
      the 10 largest indexes verified are displayed.  Verification of
      the presence of heap tuples as index tuples is requested for
      primary key indexes only.  Since no error is raised, all indexes
      tested appear to be logically consistent.  Naturally, this query
      could easily be changed to call
      <function>bt_index_check</function> for every index in the
      database where verification is supported.
     </para>
     <para>
      <function>bt_index_check</function> acquires an
      <literal>AccessShareLock</> on the target index and the heap
      relation it belongs to.  This lock mode is the same lock mode
      acquired on relations by simple <literal>SELECT</> statements.
      <function>bt_index_check</function> does not verify invariants
      that span child/parent relationships, but will verify the
      presence of all heap tuples as index tuples within the index
      when <parameter>heapallindexed</> is <literal>true</>.  When a
      routine, lightweight test for corruption is required in a live
      production environment, using
      <function>bt_index_check</function> often provides the best
      trade-off between thoroughness of verification and limiting the
      impact on application performance and availability.

      Optionally, when the <parameter>heapallindexed</> argument is
      <literal>true</>, the function verifies the presence of all heap
      tuples that should be found within the index.  The checks
      performed by <function>bt_index_parent_check</function> are a
      superset of the checks performed by
      <function>bt_index_check</function> when called with the same
      options.  <function>bt_index_parent_check</function> can be
      thought of as a more thorough variant of
      <function>bt_index_check</function>: unlike
      <function>bt_index_check</function>,
      <function>bt_index_parent_check</function> also checks
      invariants that span parent/child relationships.
      <function>bt_index_parent_check</function> follows the general
      convention of raising an error if it finds a logical
      inconsistency or other problem.

     <para>
      A <literal>ShareLock</> is required on the target index by
      <function>bt_index_parent_check</function> (a
      <literal>ShareLock</> is also acquired on the heap relation).
      These locks prevent concurrent data modification from
      <command>INSERT</>, <command>UPDATE</>, and <command>DELETE</>
      commands.  The locks also prevent the underlying relation from
      being concurrently processed by <command>VACUUM</>, as well as
      all other utility commands.  Note that the function holds locks
      only while running, not for the entire transaction.

     <para>
      <function>bt_index_parent_check</function>'s additional
      verification is more likely to detect various pathological
      cases.  These cases may involve an incorrectly implemented
      B-Tree operator class used by the index that is checked, or,
      hypothetically, undiscovered bugs in the underlying B-Tree index
      access method code.  Note that
      <function>bt_index_parent_check</function> cannot be used when
      Hot Standby mode is enabled (i.e., on read-only physical
      replicas), unlike <function>bt_index_check</function>.

  <title>Optional <parameter>heapallindexed</> verification</title>
 <para>
  When the <parameter>heapallindexed</> argument to verification
  functions is <literal>true</>, an additional phase of verification
  is performed against the table associated with the target index
  relation.  This consists of a <quote>dummy</> <command>CREATE
  INDEX</> operation, which checks for the presence of all would-be
  new index tuples against a temporary, in-memory summarizing
  structure (this is built when needed during the first, standard
  phase).  The summarizing structure <quote>fingerprints</> every
  tuple found within the target index.  The high level principle
  behind <parameter>heapallindexed</> verification is that a new index
  that is equivalent to the existing, target index must only have
  entries that can be found in the existing structure.
 </para>
 <para>
  The additional <parameter>heapallindexed</> phase adds significant
  overhead: verification will typically take several times longer than
  it would with only the standard consistency checking of the target
  index's structure.  However, verification will still take
  significantly less time than an actual <command>CREATE INDEX</>.
  There is no change to the relation-level locks acquired when
  <parameter>heapallindexed</> verification is performed.  The
  summarizing structure is bound in size by
  <varname>maintenance_work_mem</varname>.  In order to ensure that
  there is no more than a 2% probability of failure to detect the
  absence of any particular index tuple, approximately 2 bytes of
  memory are needed per index tuple.  As less memory is made available
  per index tuple, the probability of missing an inconsistency
  increases.  This is considered an acceptable trade-off, since it
  limits the overhead of verification very significantly, while only
  slightly reducing the probability of detecting a problem, especially
  for installations where verification is treated as a routine
  maintenance task.
 </para>
 <para>
  In many applications, even the default
  <varname>maintenance_work_mem</varname> setting of <literal>64MB</>
  will be sufficient to have less than a 2% probability of overlooking
  any single absent or corrupt tuple.  This will be the case when
  there are no indexes with more than about 30 million distinct index
  tuples, regardless of the overall size of any index, the total
  number of indexes, or anything else.  False positive candidate tuple
  membership tests within the summarizing structure occur at random,
  and are very unlikely to be the same for repeat verification
  operations.  Furthermore, within a single verification operation,
  each missing or malformed index tuple independently has the same
  chance of being detected.  If there is any inconsistency at all, it
  isn't particularly likely to be limited to a single tuple.  All of
  these factors favor accepting a limited per operation per tuple
  probability of missing corruption, in order to enable performing
  more thorough index to heap verification more frequently (practical
  concerns about the overhead of verification are likely to limit the
  frequency of verification).  In aggregate, the probability of
  detecting a hardware fault or software defect actually
  <emphasis>increases</> significantly with this strategy in most real
  world cases.  Moreover, frequent verification allows problems to be
  caught earlier on average, which helps to limit the overall impact
  of corruption, and often simplifies root cause analysis.

  <title>Using <filename>amcheck</> effectively</title>

 <para>
  <filename>amcheck</> can be effective at detecting various types of
  failure modes that <link
  linkend="app-initdb-data-checksums"><application>data page
  checksums</></link> will always fail to catch.  These include:

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Structural inconsistencies caused by incorrect operator class
     implementations.
    </para>
    <para>
     This includes issues caused by the comparison rules of operating
     system collations changing. Comparisons of datums of a collatable
     type like <type>text</> must be immutable (just as all
     comparisons used for B-Tree index scans must be immutable), which
     implies that operating system collation rules must never change.
     Though rare, updates to operating system collation rules can
     cause these issues. More commonly, an inconsistency in the
     collation order between a master server and a standby server is
     implicated, possibly because the <emphasis>major</> operating
     system version in use is inconsistent.  Such inconsistencies will
     generally only arise on standby servers, and so can generally
     only be detected on standby servers.
    </para>
    <para>
     If a problem like this arises, it may not affect each individual
     index that is ordered using an affected collation, simply because
     <emphasis>indexed</> values might happen to have the same
     absolute ordering regardless of the behavioral inconsistency. See
     <xref linkend="locale"> and <xref linkend="collation"> for
     further details about how <productname>PostgreSQL</> uses

    </para>
    <para>
     There is no cross-checking of indexes against their heap relation
     during normal operation.  Symptoms of heap corruption can be very

     Automatic verification of the structural integrity of indexes
     plays a role in the general testing of new or proposed
     <productname>PostgreSQL</> features that could plausibly allow a
     logical inconsistency to be introduced.  Verification of table
     structure and associated visibility and transaction status
     information plays a similar role.  One obvious testing strategy
     is to call <filename>amcheck</> functions continuously when
     running the standard regression tests.  See <xref

    <para>
     Note that <filename>amcheck</> examines a page as represented in some
     shared memory buffer at the time of verification if there is only a
     shared buffer hit when accessing the block. Consequently,
     <filename>amcheck</> does not necessarily examine data read from the
     file system at the time of verification. Note that when checksums are
     enabled, <filename>amcheck</> may raise an error due to a checksum
     failure when a corrupt block is read into a buffer.

    </para>
    <para>
     When <parameter>heapallindexed</> is <literal>true</>, and heap
